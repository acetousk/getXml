        # top level objectives

        the primary goal is to give people the tools that they need to accomplish their job because they are the

        experts in the business domain we are experts in the technology domain. the technology needs to enable the users to do what needs to get done. the best possible way to communicate what needs to get done and then actually doing it is through language and so if everything is grounded in language then what could possibly be better?

        start at the lower end of the market giving tools to small businesses that could never afford it but are like the big boy tools the enterprises get to use with thousands of people maintaining them

        ## Week 1-2

        Take be able to take handwritten business requirements and convert them into a series of logical steps, and generate a reasonably good output for a screen flow / application with users, roles,  charts, business processes, and forms (not actually working just feasible llm output and general structure).

        ## Week 3-5

        is going to be actually gathering the necessary top level business concepts, business processes etc that are needed correctly running a company in general this includes tax filing, organizational structure, profit and loss, all the generic reporting that is done.

        then gathered market specific data with a more specific organizational chart with specific roles, a business understanding, general accounting practices, etc

        then it will be a let's gather the existing standard operating procedures, documents, emails, audit logs, etc all the data that you can find about a company and generates the business process book that will then be used to generate the application that is used by the users etc

        ## week 6-8

        each individual logical step is a business process that is for a specific purpose. that purpose is then measured in one to many ways. producing a visual output and a report that can be sent to a manager

        for example a software engineer will get or create a series of tasks of various types that will be a thing to work on. each thing that is worked on will have some sort of output. the simple output is number of tasks completed in a certain time period. this would mean that a developer could see how many tasks are being completed

        so a phrase like a developer will complete tasks implies a developer role, a a task table that has various fields, and an objective and key result of tasks produced overtime per user

        some users will have multiple roles and will need to manage things accordingly. such as if you have a developer and a marketer then the developer tasks and the marketer tasks will need to be clearly distinguished

        the general patterns that are needed for this business process to application or logical steps is you take a generic set of business processes that are standard practice in every mba program. this would include analysis etc etc. once you have that then you tailor that business process towards a specific market and that market will be market dependent this will include a market-based business model for example a services versus product base business. and then you to an individual company level with this you add in the secret sauce if that company provides you have the data model industry the business practices from the mba program.

        now the business processes must include is a this is what happens. this is how to track it. this person needs this to be done. and errors that can occur.

        now as different things happen they could be chained together. the tracking needs to be as detailed as possible while not being overly burdensome to general employees. the person that it gets assigned to must be dynamically allocated for example if the person that is assigned to loses their job then must be assigned to another person with skill set similar probably through a manager. and then errors and anomalies also need to be handled such as the shipment not arriving at the customer address or a task taking too long or a spike in leads that are not converting.

        what is laid out here is an initial idea of what needs to be written but this will need to iterate over time and the ground truth here is helping real people in the company to do their jobs effectively and maybe even humanely and maybe even in a flow state.

        what is happening here is given a business process it is attached to one service and that service is associated with entities, screens, whatever. now the service will also need to include tasks being assigned to the given person, llm, or on demand contractor

        this will also must have versions as well as a version history and go back to a previous version and if a code or business level error happens then notify someone or automatically revert to the previous version.

        everything needs to be self-monitoring and validating. this is both for the AI and a continual improvements to the processes in the application as a whole.

        on user sign up there will be a selection of the industry you're part of as well as initially customizing it for the business with your business process documents. the industries could just be generic government business types or application types that have or haven't been integrated?

        ## week 9-12

        then converting each of these into executable processes as a mix of code and humans work. with an application to go along with it with proper use a rose permission authorization authentication speed functionality good user interface good user experience and integration with external tools to start out with.

        initially this would be a screen or series of screens and forms in those screens with transitions that allow the user to go through various processes. this may primarily just be a wizard to start out with and progressively get more complicated as needed as the UI needs to do more.

        what's the business process has a rough estimate of what needs to happen in the service a screenflow is generated. the screenflow will have a title and all of the text that is in the ground truth business process and must have versions as things are going to be changed as well as a published version and go back into time and publish a previous version. each version will have to keep track of both code errors and business level errors and over time they will be able to automatically revert to a previous version if there is an error Spike.

        there were also need to be charts and reports sent to an upper level of management/yourself for some sort of kpi/okr/goal/metric. on a certain time interval. this needs to be associated with the business process but not necessarily part of it actual thing that the business is doing

        another thing to keep in mind is that there are going to be meeting set up on the organization that could and should be tracked and should have some sort of integration and tracking and business process assigned to it

        the application will initially just be very bare Bones just get anything working. over time there will be components that are used and those components may be used with rive and custom animations and just make them beautiful eventually as an ideal.

        the application will be somewhat dashboard based for general metrics on first load and being able to see tasks that need to get done immediately and just start doing them.

        here is probably where a basic integration with basic tools will need to be figured out this would include a data model to data model transformer with accounting for one to many or many to one of the fields.

        the initial sell is you can start using this tool with your existing data platforms and processes put over time you will want to move to it because it is so much easier to do everything. it is not a toy. I believe that in the modern day this is required for any platform, or at least a good data integration
